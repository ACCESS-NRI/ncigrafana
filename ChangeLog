CHANGES
=======

* Made entry points for DB updating scripts in setup.py and corresponding functions in scripts
* Added fullname output to nci\_usage, and an option for separator to crudely create csv output

0.3.2
-----

* Updated README with current module load instructions

0.3.1
-----

*     Reindex storage dataframes to ensure there are values from the start     of each quarter

0.3
---

* Fix variable scoping
* Put the flag on the wrong line
* Add coecms channel for dataset package
* Project should be an argument
* Add conda build infrastructure
* Python3 compat
* Use a in-memory database
* Use package
* Add setup.py packaging
* Added default value into size table when pivoting as NaN would appear if a user deleted all their storage in a project
* Check for no data to plot. Triggered sometimes with delta plots when there is no change
* Check for data lookup errors and don't try and plot
* Allow datetime objects in database when they creep in
* Add a command to list usage in the terminal

0.2
---

* Delta plots were being chopped off below zero. Fixed
* Python 3 print statements fixed in make scripts
* Removed spurious pip install and 3.5 build (which had dependency issues)
* Incorrect name for conda sqlite package
* Switched to conda to get updated version of sqlite3
* Specified trusty dist for travis to get sqlite3 version which supports printf
* Added tests for pandas interface. Added pandas dependency to travis
* Fixed tests that were assuming dates returned from DB were strings not datetime objects
* Made returned data frame have proper dates in the index. Fixed logic for plotting ideal usage. Made long SQL queries multiline to make more readable
* Reinstated pdf output. Added checks for empty dataframes and warning
* Only plot if db connection successful. Ensure ideal usage plotted even if users specified
* Reinstated ability to plot data from specific users
* Working version with refactored code using pandas dataframes
* Initial stages of nci\_monitor.py rewrite. Working but will not refactor
* Added pandas data retrieval. More generic and powerful
* Added licence to nci\_monitor.py
* Changes to DBcommon.py: python3 support, added license, fixed bug in datetoyearquarter with python3
* getstoragepoints working
* Beginning adding gdata data extraction
* BUG: Change in formatting led to project usage being lost. Fixed
* Bug : parsing usage like 0B was incorrectly handled. Fixed
* Bug: make\_SU\_DB.py : was storing SUs not KSUs. Fixed
* BUG: nci\_monitor.py : axes referenced before being created. Fixed
* Parsing size in DB module was wrong, and also broke tests. Fixed that up and reverted tests
* Updated usage parsing to support units other than KSU. Made unit testing more robust and general. Added tests for unit parsing
* Fixed logic errors when checking if there was data to plot
* Made full names default, added --username option for old behaviour. Added -n option to limit number of users plotted
* Made figure bigger and reduced legend fontsize to fit more users in legend
* Added --shorttotal option to show short file system limit + test
* Fixed typo in help message
* Broke tests with change to API. Fixed
* Fixed gdata upload. Added storagept key, and parsing the filename for storagept
* Big Fix. Cast strings to floats before loading into DB. This fixed error with not sorting by usage correctly when returning SU users
* Delta short usage also needs filling, otherwise deleted use directories don't show up as negative on the graph
* Filling in short usage algorithm was leading to erroneous result when a user's directory was removed and had no data. Now just fill with zeroes
* Included year and quarter in title, as removed year them from axis
* Improved date formatting
* Restrict coverage testing to core module
* Add some more badges
* Test silentrm
* Slightly bogus commit, as I stuffed up with a forced push
* From codecov analysis, remove duplicate test and squawked when file remove failed
* Fixed error, wasn't saving correct figure for short
* Added hardcopy output option (--pdf)
* Put proper codecov hook at the end
* Added custom codecov invocation
* Added codecov hooks to travis CI
* Added travis CI badge
* Replaced DISTINCT calls with groupby, which are supposed to work with ordering by an un-selected field
* Checking default sqlite3 version
* Removed dependency on matplotlib
* Specified test directory
* Removed unecessary packages
* Added dataset install
* Added directories to pythonpath
* Set pythonpath correctly in travis.yml
* Try py.test without specifying test directory
* Trying another trick to get py.test to see modules
* Ugly hack to get py.test to work, added empty conftest.py
* Added empty \_\_init\_\_.py to fix travis path problem
* Fixed travis script command
* Added travis
* Create README.md
* Unit test, using pytest, added
* Added explicit scale when retrieving SU usage. Added some more class functions to support unit tests
* Added DBcommon.py. Deleted UsageDB.py -- old file accidentally included
* Added nci\_monitor
* Initial commit of dataset approach
